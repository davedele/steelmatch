# SteelMatch Pro — Simple Guide

A fast way to get matched with qualified **U.S. steel and metals manufacturers**. Describe your job in plain English. Get verified shops with the right capabilities, certifications, and lead times.

---

## What you can do here
- **Find suppliers** for machining, cutting, forming, welding, and finishing.
- **Filter by needs** like material grade (e.g., 304 SS), tolerance (e.g., ±0.005"), quantity/weight, lead time, and location.
- **See what matters**: certifications (ISO 9001, AS9100), capacity/activity signals, sustainability details where available.

> Goal: a short list of U.S. partners who can actually deliver—fast.

---

## How it works (3 steps)
1) **Tell us your job** in a single message. Example: *“Need 500 lbs of 304 stainless parts, CNC milled to ±0.005", ship in 2 weeks, near Texas.”*
2) **We parse and match** using trusted B2B signals and public data. U.S. only.
3) **You get a short list** of suppliers ranked by fit, with clear reasons and next steps.
